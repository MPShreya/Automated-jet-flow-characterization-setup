# Automated-jet-flow-characterization-setup

Project title: Design of an automated jet flow characterization set up

Duration: Jan 2022 - May 2022


_Description: Designed and built a robust and cost effective setup which can be used to study the velocity profile of an air jet, identify the characteristics of a jet and the entrainment of air near the jet. Explored the area of flow measurement systems. Gained experience in project planning and budget preparation. Project done as part of Open Ended Lab Project (OELP) course._
